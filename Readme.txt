DatasetFormation.py - To create the dataset to data2.csv file and to show the curves for different threshold for single compressed and double compressed images.
final.py - Give the result wheather image is single compressed or double compressed
Imageformationcompressed.py - forms the dataset of single and double compressed images given an uncompressed images
maintestplots.py - gives the histgrams and fft plots for testing in single image

The dataset created have not been used to determine the threshold, I used just some values considering the data generated which gave us results in some of the cases, but there were false results, the right way to train it is to determine the right threshold training over the genrated data

We have used the UCID dataset of Uncompressed Images for dataset generation
